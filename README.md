# üéÆ Breakout Coding Agent

A classic Breakout game built with .NET, designed to test and validate GitHub Copilot Coding Agent workflows.

## ü§ñ Project Purpose

This project implements a **two-track RFC approach**:

### **Track 1: Flow RFCs (Workflow Engineering)**
Solve GitHub Coding Agent workflow issues to enable reliable automation:
- ‚úÖ Flow-RFC-001: Basic PR Merge Cycle
- ‚è≥ Flow-RFC-002: Conflict Resolution Strategy  
- ‚è≥ Flow-RFC-003: Quality Gates Integration
- ‚è≥ Flow-RFC-004: Issue-PR-RFC Linking
- ‚è≥ Flow-RFC-005: Agent Prompt Engineering

### **Track 2: Game RFCs (Breakout Implementation)**
Once workflow is solid, GitHub Coding Agent implements game features:
- ‚è≥ Game-RFC-001: Console Game Shell
- ‚è≥ Game-RFC-002: Paddle Implementation
- ‚è≥ Game-RFC-003: Ball Physics
- ‚è≥ Game-RFC-004: Brick System
- ‚è≥ Game-RFC-005: Game State Management

## üöÄ Quick Start

```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone <repository-url>
cd breakout-coding-agent

# Build and run
dotnet restore
dotnet build
dotnet run --project dotnet/game/Breakout.Game
```

## üìã Current Status

**Flow Engineering Phase**: ‚úÖ Flow-RFC-001 & Flow-RFC-002 COMPLETED - True automation enabled with auto-merge settings.

**Game Development Phase**: ‚úÖ Game-RFC-001 (Console Game Shell) COMPLETED. Game-RFC-002 (Paddle) ready for implementation.

**RFC Coordination**: üìå [Issue #3 - RFC Coordinator](https://github.com/GiantCroissant-Lunar/breakout-coding-agent/issues/3) (Pinned) - Central hub for all RFC implementations.
