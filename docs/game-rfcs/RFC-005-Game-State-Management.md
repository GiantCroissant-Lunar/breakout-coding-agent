## Micro-Issues for GitHub Coding Agent

### Game-RFC-005-1: **Lives System**
**Objective**: Implement a player lives system to enhance game progression

**Requirements**:
- Add Lives property to GameState or ScoreSystem
- Initialize with 3 lives at game start
- Ball loss decreases lives instead of immediate game over
- Display remaining lives on screen (hearts or numerical)
- Game over only when all lives are lost
- Reset lives when starting new game

**Implementation Details**:
- Modify Game.cs Update() method to handle life loss
- Update RenderSystem to display lives counter
- Ensure proper life reset on game restart

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Player starts with 3 lives
- Lives display is visible during gameplay
- Ball loss decreases lives by 1
- Game continues until 0 lives remain
- Lives reset properly on new game

### Game-RFC-005-2: **Win State Differentiation**
**Objective**: Create distinct Win state separate from GameOver for victory scenarios

**Requirements**:
- Add Win state to GameState enum
- Implement win condition logic (all bricks destroyed)
- Create win celebration screen in RenderSystem
- Display final score and congratulations message
- Provide options to play again or exit

**Implementation Details**:
- Modify GameState.cs to include Win state
- Update Game.cs win condition to set State = Win instead of GameOver
- Add RenderWin() method to RenderSystem
- Handle input in Win state for restart/exit options

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Separate Win state exists in GameState enum
- Win condition triggers Win state (not GameOver)
- Win screen displays congratulations message
- Final score is prominently shown on win screen
- Player can restart or exit from win screen

### Game-RFC-005-3: **Level Progression System**
**Objective**: Implement multiple levels with increasing difficulty

**Requirements**:
- Add CurrentLevel property to game state
- Create multiple brick layouts (at least 3 levels)
- Increase difficulty per level (ball speed, brick durability)
- Level completion advances to next level
- Display current level number during gameplay

**Implementation Details**:
- Add Level property to GameState or create LevelManager class
- Modify BrickLayout to support different level configurations
- Update ball speed constants based on current level
- Implement level transition logic after completing all bricks

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- At least 3 distinct levels with different brick patterns
- Ball speed increases with each level
- Level number displayed on screen during gameplay
- Smooth transition between levels
- Game completion message after final level

### Game-RFC-005-4: **High Score Persistence**
**Objective**: Implement persistent high score storage across game sessions

**Requirements**:
- Save high score to local file or registry
- Load previous high score on game startup
- Display "NEW HIGH SCORE!" message when achieved
- Show high score on main menu and game over screen
- Handle file I/O errors gracefully

**Implementation Details**:
- Create HighScoreManager class for persistence operations
- Use JSON or simple text file in user data directory
- Modify ScoreSystem to integrate with persistence
- Add high score display to menu and game over screens
- Implement error handling for file access issues

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- High score persists between game sessions
- New high score achievement is clearly indicated
- High score displays on main menu
- Graceful handling of file system errors
- No data corruption from concurrent access

### Game-RFC-005-5: **Enhanced Restart Mechanics**
**Objective**: Improve game restart functionality with multiple restart options

**Requirements**:
- Quick restart hotkey (R) during gameplay
- "Play Again" option from game over/win screens
- "Return to Menu" option from all game states
- Proper game state reset for each restart type
- Confirm dialog for restart during active gameplay

**Implementation Details**:
- Add restart key handling to InputSystem
- Modify game state transitions for restart scenarios
- Ensure proper cleanup and re-initialization
- Add confirmation prompts where appropriate
- Update UI text to show restart options

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- R key restarts current game during gameplay
- Game over/win screens offer play again option
- All restart scenarios properly reset game state
- No memory leaks or state corruption on restart
- Clear UI indicators for available restart options

### Game-RFC-005-6: **Game Statistics Tracking**
**Objective**: Track and display comprehensive game statistics

**Requirements**:
- Track total games played across sessions
- Track total bricks destroyed lifetime
- Calculate and display average score
- Show play time statistics
- Display stats on main menu or dedicated stats screen

**Implementation Details**:
- Create GameStatistics class for data management
- Implement persistent storage for statistics
- Add statistics display to UI (menu or separate screen)
- Update statistics during gameplay events
- Format statistics for readable display

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Statistics persist across game sessions
- All key metrics are tracked accurately
- Statistics are displayed in user-friendly format
- Performance impact is minimal
- Statistics reset option available

## Implementation Priority
1. **RFC-005-1** (Lives System) - Core gameplay enhancement
2. **RFC-005-2** (Win State) - Essential for proper game completion
3. **RFC-005-5** (Enhanced Restart) - Quality of life improvement
4. **RFC-005-4** (High Score Persistence) - Player engagement
5. **RFC-005-3** (Level Progression) - Extended gameplay
6. **RFC-005-6** (Statistics) - Advanced features

## Expected Outcome
Upon completion of RFC-005, the Breakout game will be a fully polished, feature-complete console application with:
- Professional game flow and state management
- Persistent data storage
- Multiple levels of gameplay
- Comprehensive statistics tracking
- Excellent user experience with proper feedback and options

This completes the full Breakout game implementation covering all 5 planned RFCs.
