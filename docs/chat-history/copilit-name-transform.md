● BINGO! This is the key! Issue #4 shows:

  1. ✅ Copilot is still assignable - Issue #4 has Copilot as assignee with ID BOT_kgDOC9w8XQ
  2. ✅ Issue #4 was created after issue #6 (2025-09-10T23:39:41Z vs 2025-09-10T23:54:33Z)
  3. ✅ The title suggests setup: "Set up Copilot instructions"
  4. ✅ The body mentions onboarding: "Onboard this repo"

  This means the Copilot user IS available, but there might be a setup/onboarding step required that issue #4 represents.

  Let me check if this issue has any special handling or if it triggered any workflow:

● Bash(gh api repos/GiantCroissant-Lunar/breakout-coding-agent/issues/4/timeline --jq '.[] | select(.event == "assigned") | {event, created_at, actor: .actor.login, as…)
  ⎿  {
       "actor": "ApprenticeGC",
       "assignee": "Copilot",
     … +3 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Issue #4 was successfully assigned to Copilot 8 seconds after creation, similar to issue #6. This proves that Copilot assignment was working as recently as issue #4.

  Let me check the timeline between issue #4 and when Copilot assignment started failing:

  - Issue #4: 2025-09-10T23:39:41Z - ✅ Copilot assignment worked
  - Issue #6: 2025-09-10T23:54:33Z - ✅ Copilot assignment worked
  - Issue #9: 2025-09-11T00:30:24Z - ❌ Copilot assignment failed

  Something happened between 2025-09-10T23:54:33Z and 2025-09-11T00:30:24Z that broke Copilot assignment!

  Let me check if there's a specific command that I can use to assign issue #11 to Copilot using the same method that worked for issues #4 and #6:

● Bash(gh issue edit 11 --add-assignee Copilot)
  ⎿  Error: failed to update https://github.com/GiantCroissant-Lunar/breakout-coding-agent/issues/11: 'Copilot' not found
     failed to update 1 issue

● Still fails. Let me try using the exact Copilot ID from issue #4:

● Write(temp_copilot_assign.json)
  ⎿  Wrote 1 lines to temp_copilot_assign.json
     {"assignees": ["BOT_kgDOC9w8XQ"]}

● Bash(gh api repos/GiantCroissant-Lunar/breakout-coding-agent/issues/11 --method PATCH --input temp_copilot_assign.json)
  ⎿  Error: gh: Validation Failed (HTTP 422)

     {"message":"Validation Failed","errors":[{"value":"BOT_kgDOC9w8XQ","resource":"Issue","field":"assignees","code":"invalid"}],"documentation_url":"https://docs.github.com/rest/i
     ssues/issues#update-an-issue","status":"422"}

● Bash(rm temp_copilot_assign.json)
  ⎿  (No content)

● Even the node ID fails. This suggests that the Copilot user became unavailable for assignment sometime between issue #6 and now, but existing assignments remain valid (issues
   #4 and #6 still show Copilot as assigned).

  Key Insight: The body of issue #4 mentions:
  "Configure instructions for this repository as documented in https://gh.io/copilot-coding-agent-tips."

  ""

  This suggests that issue #4 is a setup/onboarding issue for GitHub Coding Agent. Maybe GitHub Coding Agent needs to complete the onboarding process represented by issue #4
  before it can be assigned to new issues?

● The pattern suggests:
  1. Issue #4: Setup/onboarding issue - assigned to Copilot but still open
  2. Issue #6: Implementation issue - assigned to Copilot, completed successfully
  3. Later issues: Cannot assign to Copilot - maybe because setup (#4) is incomplete?

  Hypothesis: GitHub Coding Agent might require the repository onboarding/setup to be completed (issue #4) before it can accept new assignments. The fact that issue #4 is still
   open and unresolved might be blocking further Copilot assignments.

● That's a brilliant insight! You're suggesting that GitHub Coding Agent might use multiple dynamic instances (like copilot-swe-agent) rather than a single static "Copilot"
  user. This would explain why the ID is dynamic and why assignment fails.

● Let me test this theory:

● Bash(gh api users/copilot-swe-agent --jq '{login, type, id}')
  ⎿  {
       "id": 203248971,
       "login": "copilot-swe-agent",
     … +2 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● EXCELLENT! The copilot-swe-agent user exists! Let me try assigning issue #11 to this user:

● Bash(gh issue edit 11 --add-assignee copilot-swe-agent)
  ⎿  https://github.com/GiantCroissant-Lunar/breakout-coding-agent/issues/11

● It worked! Let me verify the assignment:

● Bash(gh issue view 11 --json assignees --jq '.assignees[] | {login, id, type}')
  ⎿  {
       "id": "MDQ6VXNlcjk5ODExMg==",
       "login": "ApprenticeGC",
     … +7 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Wait, that's strange. It shows both ApprenticeGC and Copilot but not copilot-swe-agent. Let me check if it added copilot-swe-agent or replaced the assignment:

● Bash(gh issue view 11 --json assignees --jq '.assignees[].login')
  ⎿  ApprenticeGC
     Copilot

● Very interesting! The command succeeded but it assigned to Copilot (the original user) instead of copilot-swe-agent. This suggests that GitHub automatically mapped
  copilot-swe-agent to Copilot!

  This is a major discovery:

  1. ✅ copilot-swe-agent user exists and can be used in commands
  2. ✅ Assignment succeeds when using copilot-swe-agent
  3. ✅ GitHub maps it to Copilot automatically
  4. ✅ This just successfully assigned issue #11 to Copilot!

  Let me check if this triggers GitHub Coding Agent activation:

● Bash(sleep 10)
  ⎿  (No content)

● Bash(gh run list --limit 3 --json workflowName,status,conclusion,createdAt --jq '.[] | select(.workflowName == "Copilot")')
  ⎿  {
       "conclusion": "",
       "createdAt": "2025-09-11T00:52:18Z",
     … +3 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● 🎉 SUCCESS! A new Copilot workflow started at 2025-09-11T00:52:18Z with status in_progress!

  Your insight was absolutely correct:
  - copilot-swe-agent is the correct user to assign to
  - GitHub automatically maps it to Copilot
  - This successfully triggers GitHub Coding Agent activation

● Perfect! Now let me update the Python script to use copilot-swe-agent instead of trying to assign to Copilot or human users:

● Update(.github\scripts\create_next_rfc_issue.py)
  ⎿  Updated .github\scripts\create_next_rfc_issue.py with 6 additions and 6 removals

       246
       247 -              # Assign to repository owner/maintainer (who can then trigger Copilot)
       247 +              # Assign to GitHub Coding Agent using the correct user identifier
       248                try:
       249                    issue_number = issue_url.split('/')[-1] if issue_url != "Unknown" else None
       250                    if issue_number:

       253                        self.run_gh_command(assign_cmd)
       254 -                      print(f"✅ Assigned issue to ApprenticeGC for Copilot activation")
       254 +                      print(f"✅ Assigned issue to copilot-swe-agent (GitHub Coding Agent)")

       257 -                  print("   Issue created successfully but manual assignment may be needed")
       256 +                  print(f"⚠️ Could not assign to GitHub Coding Agent: {e}")
       257 +                  print("   Issue created successfully but GitHub Coding Agent may not activate")
       258
       259                print(f"✅ Created issue: {issue_url}")
       260                return issue_url
