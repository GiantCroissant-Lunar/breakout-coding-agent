# GitHub Copilot Coding Agent Investigation Findings

**Date**: 2025-09-11  
**Context**: Investigating why GitHub Copilot Coding Agent is not creating PRs despite apparent successful assignments

## üîç Key Discoveries

### 1. Assignment Username Confusion RESOLVED

**Initial Assumption**: `copilot-swe-agent` was the correct assignment username but suddenly stopped working
**Reality**: 
- **Assignment username**: `"Copilot"` (what shows in issue assignees)
- **PR author**: `"app/copilot-swe-agent"` (the GitHub App that creates PRs)
- `copilot-swe-agent` was **NEVER** used for assignment - only as the PR author

**Historical Evidence**:
- PR #14 (created by `app/copilot-swe-agent`) had assignees: `ApprenticeGC` and `Copilot`
- Assignment timeline shows `Copilot` was assigned at `03:04:53Z`, PR created at `03:04:57Z`
- Fallback workflow (commit ef48202) was added because `copilot-swe-agent` assignments were failing

### 2. Assignment Behavior Analysis

**Test Results**:

#### Issue #15: Copilot Assignment ‚úÖ
- Command: `gh api repos/.../issues/15/assignees -X POST -f assignees[]=Copilot`
- Result: `"assignee": {"login": "Copilot", "id": 198982749}`
- Reactions: `"eyes": 1` (üëÄ emoji added)
- Status: **Assignment successful, GitHub Copilot acknowledged**

#### Issue #21: copilot-swe-agent Assignment ‚ùå
- Command: `gh api repos/.../issues/21/assignees -X POST -f assignees[]=copilot-swe-agent`  
- Result: `"assignee": null, "assignees": []`
- Reactions: `"eyes": 0` (no emoji)
- Status: **Silent failure - assignment doesn't stick**

### 3. Current Problem: No GitHub Actions Runs

**Symptom**: Even successful `Copilot` assignments (with üëÄ reactions) are not triggering GitHub Actions runs

**Issues with successful assignments but no activity**:
- Issue #13: Assigned to Copilot, has üëÄ reaction, but no PR created
- Issue #15: Assigned to Copilot, has üëÄ reaction, but no PR created

**Monitoring Results**: 6 checks over 3 minutes showed only our scheduled workflows, no GitHub Copilot activity

## üö® Critical Issues Identified

### Repository Configuration Issues

Based on GitHub Copilot documentation research:

1. **GitHub Actions Dependency**: Copilot requires GitHub-hosted runners (not self-hosted)
2. **Managed User Account Restrictions**: Personal repos with managed accounts can't use Copilot
3. **Workflow Approval**: GitHub Actions workflows need manual "Approve and run workflows" approval
4. **Plan Requirements**: Needs Copilot Pro/Pro+/Business/Enterprise
5. **Repository Setup**: May need `.github/workflows/copilot-setup-steps.yml`

### Potential Root Causes

1. **Missing Repository Setup**: No `copilot-setup-steps.yml` workflow
2. **Plan/Permission Issues**: Account may not have proper Copilot plan access
3. **GitHub Actions Approval**: Copilot's Actions may need manual approval
4. **Enterprise Policy**: Administrator may need to enable Copilot policy

## üìã Action Items for Resolution

### Immediate Investigation Needed
1. ‚úÖ Verify GitHub Copilot plan access for repository owner
2. ‚úÖ Check if `.github/workflows/copilot-setup-steps.yml` is needed
3. ‚úÖ Confirm GitHub Actions are enabled and working for repository
4. ‚úÖ Check for any pending workflow approval requirements
5. ‚úÖ Verify repository isn't using managed user account restrictions

### Testing Protocol
1. ‚úÖ Create test issue with clear, well-scoped requirements
2. ‚úÖ Assign to `Copilot` (not `copilot-swe-agent`)
3. ‚úÖ Monitor for üëÄ reaction (confirms acknowledgment)
4. ‚úÖ Monitor GitHub Actions for coding agent runs
5. ‚úÖ Check for any approval prompts in GitHub Actions tab

## üîß Workflow Fixes Applied

### 1. Assignment Workflow Fixed
**File**: `.github/workflows/assign-copilot.yml`
**Change**: Removed `copilot-swe-agent` attempts, use only `Copilot`
**Commit**: f057476

### 2. Force Reset Workflow Fixed  
**File**: `.github/workflows/force-reset-stale-agent-branches.yml`
**Change**: Added check to prevent resetting completed (non-draft) PRs
**Commit**: 2ab611a

### 3. RFC Health Monitor Fixed
**File**: `.github/workflows/rfc-health-monitor.yml`  
**Change**: Fixed assignee query to properly detect Copilot assignments
**Commit**: f17f4f4

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Outstanding Questions

1. **Why did previous Copilot assignments work?** (PR #14, #16 were created successfully)
2. **What changed between working assignments and current non-working ones?**
3. **Are there GitHub Copilot repository-specific settings that need enabling?**
4. **Does the repository need special onboarding for GitHub Copilot coding agent?**

## üìä Current Status

- ‚úÖ **Assignment mechanism**: Working (`Copilot` username confirmed)
- ‚úÖ **GitHub Copilot acknowledgment**: Working (üëÄ reactions present)  
- ‚ùå **GitHub Actions execution**: Not working (no coding agent runs)
- ‚ùå **PR creation**: Not happening despite successful assignments

**Next Step**: Focus on repository configuration and GitHub Actions setup requirements for GitHub Copilot coding agent.
