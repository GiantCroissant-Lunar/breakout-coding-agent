# Flow-RFC-001: Basic PR Merge Cycle

**Status**: üîÑ Implementing  
**Priority**: Critical  
**Dependencies**: None  
**Implementation**: Local Agent (Claude/GPT)

## üéØ Problem Statement

GitHub Coding Agent cannot complete full development cycles because:
1. PRs are created but not merged automatically
2. No reliable workflow for branch ‚Üí implement ‚Üí merge cycle
3. Previous experimental projects failed at the basic PR merge step
4. Need foundation workflow before any Game-RFC implementation

## üéØ Goal

Establish a reliable, automated PR merge cycle that GitHub Coding Agent can complete without human intervention.

## üìã Acceptance Criteria

### **Core Workflow**
- [ ] GitHub Coding Agent can create feature branch (`copilot/flow-rfc-001-test`)
- [ ] Can make targeted file changes (update specific line in README.md)
- [ ] Can create PR with proper title and description format
- [ ] GitHub Actions automatically validates and merges PR
- [ ] Feature branch is automatically deleted after merge
- [ ] Main branch contains the merged changes

### **Validation Tests**
- [ ] Manual test: Create GitHub issue asking agent to update README status
- [ ] Agent creates PR that merges successfully without human intervention
- [ ] Workflow handles basic scenarios (single file change, no conflicts)
- [ ] Auto-merge only triggers for Flow-RFC-001 test PRs (safety)

### **Quality Gates**
- [ ] Only README.md is modified (single file change constraint)
- [ ] Change is exactly as specified (no extra modifications)
- [ ] PR title follows format: "Flow-RFC-001: [description]"
- [ ] GitHub Actions logs show successful auto-merge execution

## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation

### **1. GitHub Actions Auto-Merge Workflow**
`.github/workflows/auto-merge.yml`:
- Triggers on PRs from `copilot/` branches
- Validates PR contains "Flow-RFC-001" in title
- Confirms only README.md was changed
- Auto-approves and squash merges
- Deletes feature branch

### **2. Test Change Specification**
README.md line change:
```markdown
# FROM:
**Flow Engineering Phase**: Implementing basic PR merge cycle to validate GitHub Coding Agent can complete full development workflow.

# TO:
**Flow Engineering Phase**: ‚úÖ Basic PR merge cycle validated - GitHub Coding Agent can complete full development workflow.
```

### **3. GitHub Coding Agent Instructions**
AGENTS.md updated to focus only on Game-RFCs, not Flow-RFCs.

### **4. Test Protocol**
1. Create GitHub issue: "Update README status for Flow-RFC-001 completion"
2. GitHub Coding Agent should:
   - Create `copilot/flow-rfc-001-test` branch
   - Make the specified README.md change
   - Create PR with title "Flow-RFC-001: Validate basic PR merge cycle"
   - Auto-merge should handle the rest

## üö® Risk Mitigation

### **Safety Constraints**
- Auto-merge only for PRs with "Flow-RFC-001" in title
- Single file change validation (reject if multiple files modified)
- Specific branch name pattern (`copilot/flow-rfc-001-test`)

### **Fallback Plan**
If auto-merge fails:
1. Review GitHub Actions logs
2. Manually merge the PR to complete Flow-RFC-001
3. Debug and fix auto-merge for Flow-RFC-002
4. Document specific failure points

## üìä Success Metrics

### **Technical Success**
- GitHub Coding Agent creates PR ‚úÖ
- Auto-merge workflow executes ‚úÖ  
- PR merges without human intervention ‚úÖ
- Feature branch cleaned up ‚úÖ
- No build or lint errors ‚úÖ

### **Process Success**
- End-to-end workflow completes in < 5 minutes
- No manual steps required
- Repeatable for future RFCs
- Clear error messages if workflow fails

## üîÑ Next Steps

### **After Flow-RFC-001 Success**
1. **Flow-RFC-002**: Conflict Resolution Strategy
2. **Flow-RFC-003**: Quality Gates Integration (CI/CD)
3. **Flow-RFC-004**: Issue-PR-RFC Linking
4. **Flow-RFC-005**: Agent Prompt Engineering

### **Game-RFC Implementation**
Once Flow RFCs are solid:
1. Create issues for Game-RFC-001 through Game-RFC-005
2. GitHub Coding Agent implements game features
3. Workflow automatically handles all PR merges
4. Working Breakout game emerges from automated development

## üéØ Definition of Done

Flow-RFC-001 is complete when:
- [ ] GitHub Coding Agent successfully merges at least one PR automatically
- [ ] Auto-merge workflow is tested and validated
- [ ] README.md shows "‚úÖ Basic PR merge cycle validated"
- [ ] Process is documented and repeatable
- [ ] Ready to proceed to Flow-RFC-002

**This is the foundation. Everything else depends on proving this works reliably.**
