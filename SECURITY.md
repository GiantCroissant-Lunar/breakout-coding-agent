# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We aim to support the default branch. Older branches may not receive security updates unless otherwise noted in release notes.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please do not open public issues for security vulnerabilities.

1. Report privately by opening a GitHub issue with the prefix `[SECURITY]` and request a maintainer to initiate a private channel, or mention `@GiantCroissant-Lunar` to request contact.
2. Provide details to reproduce, affected versions/commit, and potential impact.
3. We will acknowledge receipt within 72 hours and work to verify and address the issue promptly.

If the vulnerability involves a third-party dependency, we may coordinate disclosure with upstream.

## Disclosure

Once a fix is available, we will disclose the issue in release notes or a security advisory with appropriate credit, unless you prefer to remain anonymous.
